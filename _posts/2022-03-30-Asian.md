A positive result in the 2022 Asian LeMans series, with Car 89 finishing 7th, car 59 finishing 17th overall, the results improving every race.

Working with Garage 59, we found significant chassis and tyre performance across the two weeks, leading to a podium in the 4th round. 

There remains, as always, much to learn, however James's fastest time in Abu Dhabi was a 1min54s, putting his time very much up there with the field.

The 2022 results set the foundations for a competitive 2023 campaign.
